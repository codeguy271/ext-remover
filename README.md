# EXT-REMOVER
This is a curated list of exploits for ChromeOS. It started with LTBEEF, and now there is more!
Many of these exploits can destroy your computer if used improperly. So PLEASE PLEASE make sure you follow these instructions very carefully!

<details>
<summary><b>LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

From [ltmeat.bypassi.com](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com), if you are interested in how this exploit works, check out that website.

1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. `chrome://extensions`, `chrome://extensions-internals`, and `chrome://process-internals` are all good places to find your extension's ID (a 32-character lowercase string). You can also just do a simple Google search. Once you have your ID, substitute it into the hostname in the URL below:

```
chrome-extension://extensionidhereblahblah/manifest.json
```

For some filters like Securly, the block screen is already an extension page. 

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C). 
3. While on the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
4. Instantly start spamming `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 

If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can close your tabs and the extension will basically be dead. If nothing loads, then you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.

### "Help me! I'm an idiot!"

Turns out that I had far too much faith in society when making this page. Some of you skids out there are really, really stupid and also can't read. So here are the answers to some commonly asked questions. 

**How do I get an extension ID?**

Okay, fair. Extension IDs are leaked in a couple of places. Generally, the best way to get them is to go to extension settings and copy the URL query value.

**It says blocked by client?**

That's the message you get when you try to visit a page belonging to an extension that doesn't exist. The error message (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`) is extremely misleading. Nobody blocked it--you just need to find the right extension ID (see above).

If you got this because you tried to visit the `extension_id_here_please` example URL, you should be extremely ashamed of yourself. Please change and grow as a person. 

**I don't have a bookmarks bar!!!!**

First, try running ctrl+shift+B. If that doesn't work, go to `chrome://settings` and turn on the "home button" feature, then set it to `chrome://hang`. A home icon should show up to the right of your refresh icon in the top left. Use that instead of bookmark C.

There is a version where you don't need bookmarklets, but I am currently gatekeeping it (L). Check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted. 

**I disabled an extension but now I can't load websites!**

If you actually just read the write-up, you'd know that this would happen if the extension's background page loaded and its listeners were already initialized before you used `chrome://hang`. You can double-check whether the extension is listening using `chrome://extensions-internals`, assuming you have a few brain cells in your head.

Anyway, no listeners mean you were too slow. Either you waited more than three seconds between bookmark B and reloading the page, or you weren't spamming bookmark C fast enough. The most reliable fix for this is to just restart your computer and try again. Try to match the pace of the gif below: (note the reload) 

![image](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/img/abc.gif)

**The bookmarks don't do anything when I click them!**

Might be admin-blocked. Either be smart enough to figure out another way, or check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted.

**I disabled the extension, why is some stuff still blocked?**

I have bad news for you... not all filters are Chrome Extensions. And again, make sure the extension pages (like bookmark A) are frozen before you assume that your skiddy self successfully did the exploit.

<summary><b>Temporary LTMEAT</b> Temporarily disable extensions</summary>

**A method of using LTMEAT that does not require `chrome://` urls.
Works by using 80-150 tabs to soak up memory.**

1. Create a bookmark with the link chrome://extensions/?id=idhereidkimaskid and name it “Kill switch”.

2. Create a new bookmark folder. Name it “spam.js”. Next, paste this link into your browser: chrome-extension://idhereidkimaskid/background.js

3. Then right-click on your folder and hit “Add Page”. Press Enter.

4. Right-click on the folder again and hit “Bookmark Manager”. You should see your page. Click on it and hit Ctrl+C. Press Ctrl+V until you have 38 of them.

5. Go to a new tab and right click your folder. Press “Open All (38)”.

6. Repeat step 3, then click on one of the tabs from this batch. Wait until the “this page is taking too long” popup appears. This will take 30-60 seconds. If it doesn’t, do chrome://restart and go back to step 2 and add 3-4 more pages to the folder.

7. Once the popup happens, right-click on one of the tabs closest to the right of the screen and hit “Duplicate”. Then, go to your “Kill switch” bookmark and look for a switch to flip, “Allow Access to File:// urls” or something. Then, click on the leftmost extension tab (one that opened from the main.js folder) and click “close all tabs to the right”. KEEP THIS TAB OPEN!!!

Tips: Go to chrome://settings/performance and turn Memory Saver off, and in the box where it says “Keep these sites always active” paste in the extension url. I’ve noticed clicking on one of the tabs from the second batch seems to help with reliability.

<summary><b>Baby LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**Patched On Chrome Versions 115 And Above**

BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGES.

1. Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.

2. Visit that chrome-extension://blockeridhere page, then type chrome://hang in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.

3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.

4. Go to the chrome://extensions page for the blocker extension you want to Disable.

5. If that page has any sort of switch, such as "Allow access to file URLs", click that switch. If there are no clickable switches, cry in a corner or something.

The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now.

<summary><b>NEW LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

  **If your Chromebook has received the 115 And Above patch on the stable channel Then Here's A New Method For LTMEAT**


**Unpatched on 115 and above**

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page lots of times. (About 800 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.

2. Right click and open all in a new window.

3. Close the window with all those tabs.

4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed. (Equivalent to the duplicate tab step in Bypassi's method)

5. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.

6. Close everything and you're good to go. If it didn't work, try adjusting the number of tabs being opened. Bypassi should add this to his website as Alternate Method # 2. With this workaround, LTMEAT can endure a longer life!

<details>
<summary><b>Baby NEW LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**Unpatched on 115 and above**

1. First of all, get your folder with 800+ extension page tabs and open it in a new window, for my Chromebook i used 800 extension page tabs as i feel it's the right amount for me

2. Close the newly opened Window with 800+ extension page tabs

3. Click into your folder, and open one of the extension page tab in a new window, maybe waiting slightly longer this time, to confirm it worked. If it loads, you did it wrong. If you see a "page unresponsive screen, and a wait/exit page button" you did it right. BUT DO NOT CLICK THE EXIT PAGE BUTTON OR WAIT BUTTON. (Or if you want to do it fast you can just see that the page always has a spinning loading circle)

4. Now go to `chrome://extensions/?id=yourblockerID`  Then scroll down and flick the "allow access to file URLs" lever and close the window with the 1 extension page tab remaining.

A bookmarklet capable of installing extensions, for those without an allowlist. 

Steps: 
Go to <a href="https://extension-installer.glitch.me/code.js">here</a> bookmark the code there (Might make a DNS)
go to chrome.google.com/webstorex and use the bookmarklet, then put the icon of the extension, the id, and the name of it (This does not matter, you can put anything), then
press download, and it will work.
**Extra Notes**
- Credit to "Aka, but nice" on Discord.
- DNS will be up soon for those who have JavaScript bookmarklets blocked.
- This will not work if you have a blocklist this is only for if when you go to the web store it shows blocked

<summary><b> Point-Blank</b> Execute scripts on extension pages</summary>

This exploit allows you to execute scripts on extensions pages, this is a great example of how Chromebooks are a piece of garbage.

<i>Getting started</i>
(Note: if bookmarklets are blocked you're screwed.)
1. Go to <a href="https://spot-maze-chinchilla.glitch.me/ingot.js">here</a> ([if blocked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/ext-remover/main/newpointblank.js)) on your school chromebook.
2. Make a bookmark with the code there.
3. Once that is done,

 If you have Securly go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly">here</a> if it says blocked by Chrome, reload (you have to actually have Securly ofc)
 
 If you have iBoss visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofboss">here</a>.
For Cisco Umbrella, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofumbrella">here</a>.
 
 If you have Blocksi go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofsi">here</a>.
 
 And if you have GoGuardian (might not work), go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofguardian">here</a>. 
 
 Now most of these links are a block page(this is intentional) on each page should have a blue link, click the link on the page if it opens a blank page click the bookmarklet that you just made and click either hard disable or soft disable, you can also run some of the scripts and run your own code, your extension may disable javascript running on it, so running your own code may not work.
 
**Extra notes**
- I recommend doing soft disable, which only disables it until restart. 
- The launcher was made by me, but the idea was from <a href="https://bolg.glitch.me/_/point-blank/">Bypassi#7037</a>
- If your school updated GoGuardian, this exploit may not work.

<summary><b>CAUB</b> Prevent Updates</summary>

This exploit keeps your Chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over. This exploit was found by Catakang#0987. Using onc files, you can convince your Chromebook that the wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and thus it will not check for updates.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/212685932-ef9c802e-6040-42a3-be6e-10997162b7cd.png)

<i>Getting started</i>

1. Go to `chrome://network#state` (on your school-issued Chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of "favorite" wifi that you've connected to in the past.
3. Click the `+` sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your Chromebook to.
4. The more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the "favorites" section.
5. Use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page.
6. Go to [caub.glitch.me](https://caub.glitch.me/).
7. Paste the copied text into the textbox below.
8. Press the `generate onc` button below the textbox.
9. Once you have downloaded the file, go to `chrome://network#general`.
10. Click on the `import ONC` button.
11. Import the newly-downloaded file.

**Extra notes**
- Your Chromebook will no longer automatically update. (as long as you are on a wifi that you used CAUB on)
- Be careful not to stay on wifi for too long without using CAUB on it, otherwise you might update.
- We cannot guarantee that this will work on every wifi

<summary><b>LTBEEF inspect</b> Using inspect to disable extensions</summary>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/207386423-e6aa2095-d92d-44a8-a3d6-e42066bdf34e.png)

The screenshot below was preformed on `108.0.5359.75` (Official Build) (64-bit) on the stable channel. This has been tested and does work but has varying levels of success, you will need access to inspect element, more specifically, console.

1. Open this on your chromebook: 
```
chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/manifest.json
``` 
Shortened link: https://tinyurl.com/i-ltbeef
2. Open inspect and navigate to the console tab.
3. Run the basic LTBEEF code such as
```js
chrome.management.setEnabled('extensionid', false)
```
Replacing `extensionid` with the ID of the extension you want to disable, e.g. the stuff after the = in the URL bar when you click the extension's "details" button in chrome://extensions

Credit to SprinkzMC#8421 (aka Bypassi) for finding this!

<summary><b>Blank3r</b> Reload extensions continuously</summary>

Point Blank is an exploit that allows you to run bookmarklets on privileged pages, such as the Chrome extensions page. This exploit was made with Point Blank as well.

The exploit code is below.
1. Bookmark this code:

```js
javascript:let shim = false;var ids = prompt("extension ids (comma separated)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 145);
```

And the GUI is in launcher.js

2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

3. Click on an extension that YOU installed from the Chrome Web Store > Details.

4. In the URL bar, copy the string of letters and numbers after the `/?id=`.

5. Click "View in Chrome Web Store" and spam the escape key. If it loads into Chrome Webstore try again, if it is a blank screen click the bookmarklet.

5. Paste the id of the extension into the prompt separated by commas.

If you close the tab, the exploit will stop working.

<summary><b>Killcurly</b> Break extensions</summary>
Kill extension, by signing out.

1. Visit `chrome://settings/signOut`, the O in Out must be capitalized.
2. Press the big blue button
3. Go to `chrome://restart`
4. Now visit `tinyurl.com/AddSession` or [this link](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession)
5. Add your **SCHOOL** account back. It WILL NOT WORK if you add a home account back. This is just so you can still access Google Drive, YouTube, and any Google service.
6. All extensions should stop working.
7. Note that you have to repeat this every time you restart or sign out.
8. If your Chrome version is `v112`, this exploit will no longer work, the bypass to this is listed further on. Visit`chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` click current settings, and it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
And visit `chrome://restart`.

<summary><b>Extention Inactivity hack</b> Inactive Extensions</summary>

1. First do the Esc+Refresh+Power

2. ctrl+d then enter

3. will give you some bullcrap about dev mode being blocked press enter then you will go to a newly restarted Chromebook

4. next add wifi-

5. then sign into your account

6. Immediately turn wifi off before extensions load

7. go to chrome://settings/signOut

8. click Turn off sync and personalization and then turn wifi back on go to whatever site that is extension blocked.

1. Workaround for chrome://settings/signOut if patched: If the link gets patched and you no longer see the blue button, go to `chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` and click current settings, it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
2. Workaround for `chrome://settings/signOut` and `javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");` if both patched: Just go to `chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced` and click 
Customize sync and then flip off the Extensions and Apps

Note: Before you do any of the method 4 tricks only do this at home so that way you don't have to worry about asking for the school wifi password.

Name of Bookmarklet > Unblock Website: `javascript:open('https://YOUR WEBSITE HERE?'+'i'.repeat(1))`

Note: Save `chrome-extension://Paste` the blocker id here/manifest.json as a bookmark so you don´t have to come back here and type in the URL thing.
